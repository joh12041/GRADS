GRADS
=====

CSCI 5801 Fall 2014 Project - Group 1

In addition to the updates we made to GRADS.java, we have two new classes: GRADSTestBasedOnAssignment2.java and GRADSTestAllTests.java. These two classes implement test cases from Assignment 2 and then that in addition to several more to reach 80% statement coverage. They depend on JUnit jars (included in the lib/ folder) and were developed in IntelliJ. They also pull from additional .txt files found in resources, but the GRADS.java interface still only depends on students.txt, courses.txt, and users.txt.
